GIT:
You are free to create as many branches as you like. Please follow the naming convention for your branches to avoid collisions. "initials/name" e.g. "js/plot" for Julia's plotting branch. You can base your branches on the master branch which is our only common branch. master always contains a working and stable version. Therefore don't push or merge to master unless you are 100% sure what you do!!! Also DON'T rewrite the history of master branch. In your own branches you are free to do whatever you want. Even though I recommend the following:
-only commit working versions (one reason for example is git bisect)
-don't rewrite your history (might break others work based on yours)
-don't push with force (most of the timer there is a reason why...)
